# How to Anki from 0 to Pro
## Intro
I've always really struggled with using Anki and setting up something that looked nice and was easy to add cards to quickly. I started using Anki for language learning in 2020 when I was studying Korean at Sogang University.
I searched the web at the time for good flash cards, and Anki was highly recommended, but very hard to use and terrible to look at. I wanted to improve it and looked into getting a template, but every time I tried to do add something, I just didn't work out well and my other options were buying anki deck templates, which I didn't want to do. 
After studying computer programming, and getting back into Anki in 2022, I decided to take another look at Anki and see if I could solve some heartache for others. I managed to make something a little bit more palatable and wanted to provide my tips and templates to the public for use.

## Setting up Anki 
Please follow the instructions on https://apps.ankiweb.net/ to get started with installing Anki. I am using a windows 11 device so my instructions in this guide will be for Windows 11.

## After Downloading Anki 
After you finish Downloading Anki and installing it on your system, you can open up the program. When you first open up Anki, you might see a popup called profiles.

<br>
In this area you can create and add/remove profiles to organize different decks. For example I could easily make a profile here for Korean, so it could be seperate from my Software Engineering profile.
You can make modifications to anki here as well, by opening a backup or downgrading/quitting the program.

To start with anki just select a profile and click the open button (or just double click a profile.)

## What's what in Anki
After opening up a profile in Anki, you will see a main screen where there is a tool bar that says: Decks, Add, Browse, Stats and Sync.
This is the place where you can do a lot in Anki, the user interface is kind of confusing, but this is an important piece of the app.

### Decks
Let's talk about the deck section, you can see it when Anki is open and it's just on the main screen.

Currently in this screenshot I have one Deck called "100Devs Anki Deck" and six subdecks connected to this deck.

If I click the minus button next to the deck name I can collapse the subdecks and just see the main deck

If you click the cogwheel at the far right of the deck/subdeck listings you can make modifications to the decks (Rename, option, export, delete)

You can also see study stats at the bottom on the deck list:

At the bottom of the stats area you can see three buttons, "Get Shared", "Create Deck" and "Import File"

Selecting get shared will take you to this website: https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/ where you can find downloads of decks people have made in different categories.

## How to Create Decks and Subdecks
If you click "Create Deck"

You can make a new deck that way, you will asked first for a deck name

After selecting okay, you will see it appear in your decks, 
If you want to make a subdeck, select 'Create Deck' one more time, and this time write the name of the Deck you want the subdeck to attach to, In this case it is "Test Deck"
After writing the parent deckname "Test Deck" add two colons right after it like this: "::" and then the name you want the subdeck to be called, such as "A Subdeck"

We can delete the new decks by clicking the cogwheel and selecting delete.

## How to add cards to your decks
After making decks, and having the subdecks set up we can add cards!
Just select "Add" next to the Decks link in the menu area.

You will see a new window popup called 'Add'

Things can get a little confusing here, because there is a lot of power and things you can do in this add area.
Let's break down each area one by one:
### Type 
This is where you can change the type of flashcard you are making/or change the specific template to it. 

If you select the words in the box next to type:

You will see yet another window open called "Choose Note Type"

In this particular deck, which I will provide the file .apkg for, you can see
