## Intro
I've always really struggled with using Anki and setting up something that looked nice and was easy to add cards to quickly. I started using Anki for language learning in 2020 when I was studying Korean at Sogang University.
I searched the web at the time for good flash cards, and Anki was highly recommended, but very hard to use and terrible to look at. I wanted to improve it and looked into getting a template, but every time I tried to do add something, I just didn't work out well and my other options were buying anki deck templates, which I didn't want to do. 
After studying computer programming, and getting back into Anki in 2022, I decided to take another look at Anki and see if I could solve some heartache for others. I managed to make something a little bit more palatable and wanted to provide my tips and templates to the public for use.

## Setting up Anki 
Please follow the instructions on https://apps.ankiweb.net/ to get started with installing Anki. I am using a windows 11 device so my instructions in this guide will be for Windows 11.

## After Downloading Anki 
After you finish Downloading Anki and installing it on your system, you can open up the program. When you first open up Anki, you might see a popup called profiles.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193141058-d4608dfa-8fd8-45d1-9638-119628ff2774.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
<br>
In this area you can create and add/remove profiles to organize different decks. For example I could easily make a profile here for Korean, so it could be seperate from my Software Engineering profile.
You can make modifications to anki here as well, by opening a backup or downgrading/quitting the program.

To start with anki just select a profile and click the open button (or just double click a profile.)

## What's what in Anki
After opening up a profile in Anki, you will see a main screen where there is a tool bar that says: Decks, Add, Browse, Stats and Sync.
This is the place where you can do a lot in Anki, the user interface is kind of confusing, but this is an important piece of the app.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193141850-193e1fbd-ebe4-43aa-bf31-8b04d110afa5.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">

### Decks
Let's talk about the deck section, you can see it when Anki is open and it's just on the main screen.

Currently in this screenshot I have one Deck called "100Devs Anki Deck" and six subdecks connected to this deck.

If I click the minus button next to the deck name I can collapse the subdecks and just see the main deck


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193142457-e486477d-29a7-42c4-a886-949ec9588abe.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193142482-f0b69422-35ca-426c-bc60-b551d3b4b001.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">

If you click the cogwheel at the far right of the deck/subdeck listings you can make modifications to the decks (Rename, option, export, delete)


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193142647-5ab00102-756a-44f6-b1e2-7b87aee8d926.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">

You can also see study stats at the bottom on the deck list: 


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193142727-a3c33b68-e59d-4846-8a2a-283962794b26.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">

At the bottom of the stats area you can see three buttons, "Get Shared", "Create Deck" and "Import File"

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193143348-79d03932-32fd-4250-ad5b-1ef6201eecae.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
Selecting get shared will take you to this website: https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/ where you can find downloads of decks people have made in different categories.

## How to Create Decks and Subdecks
If you click "Create Deck"

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193143507-904b458c-f80e-42e9-b121-b3a1936c31db.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
You can make a new deck that way, you will asked first for a deck name

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193143613-9038a1dd-30e3-4369-bd44-42799a7a8703.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
After selecting okay, you will see it appear in your decks, 
If you want to make a subdeck, select 'Create Deck' one more time, and this time write the name of the Deck you want the subdeck to attach to, In this case it is "Test Deck"
After writing the parent deckname "Test Deck" add two colons right after it like this: "::" and then the name you want the subdeck to be called, such as "A Subdeck"

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193144056-a21e051a-825f-49ea-aa1c-c9d4416acf49.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193144179-f3f221c1-e877-4455-959c-a6f02c27db12.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
We can delete the new decks by clicking the cogwheel and selecting delete.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193144297-1b8c1e11-99d5-4c84-9c25-97871d4344c5.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">

## How to add cards to your decks
After making decks, and having the subdecks set up we can add cards!
Just select "Add" next to the Decks link in the menu area.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193144548-6c44def6-3fa3-4e98-a7ef-1996045953f4.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
You will see a new window popup called 'Add'

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193144635-f6cc0761-c59e-4d57-92f1-53125b7a1044.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
Things can get a little confusing here, because there is a lot of power and things you can do in this add area.
Let's break down each area one by one:
### Type 
This is where you can change the type of flashcard you are making/or change the specific template to it. 

If you select the words in the box next to type:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193144856-b5bc7496-9a84-469f-b15a-ef2672c2f4ba.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
You will see yet another window open called "Choose Note Type"

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193144983-2fce0bae-147d-4584-b672-50fc096a04d9.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
In this particular deck, which I will provide the file .apkg for, you can see the first four note types: Basic, Basic, Basic, Cloze are defaults from Anki,
and the One Cards, Two Cards are custom templates that I modified.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193145678-1004b53d-d546-4f17-ac48-48e781144963.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
I am going to select the "One Card (General) Blue | Custom by mac-kenzie-lee" note type and select choose. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193145824-f64c081f-2cf3-4ead-b2cd-7c5c872c5a86.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">

### Deck 
I can change the deck I want the card to be in by clicking Deck

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193145985-489bd047-8c37-4e6d-9215-017e51b97e7b.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
Here I will make an Html card, so I will change the deck to be the HTML Subdeck

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193146115-e0c44540-3589-4e77-b396-c77126ae99f4.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">

### Fields 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193146191-396f60dc-0dd7-4da4-82f5-c2c26941cf87.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
If I select fields, I will see another window pop up called 'Field for One Card (General) Blue | Custom by mac-kenzie-lee'
I can add/edit modify these fields and it will change what I see in the add window

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193146433-b4374c73-b90a-43ce-b49a-b61a14f3006f.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">

### Cards

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193146515-14ce9492-3dac-410b-ba84-aed7b9eb6b16.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
If I select Cards, another window called "Card Types for One Card (General) Blue | Custom by mac-kenzie-lee" will popup. Here we can see a card preview and make edits to the setup of the card, the code, and the styling.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193146587-b91940d3-7e56-4bae-a568-2677aa9ddc02.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
This card didn't have any text, so I will go back and add some text to the card, and reopen this cards section:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193146965-e0ffabdc-7354-4570-8bd8-9dff7ce27611.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
Now we can see the text preview on the card

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193147018-7d9bc770-5520-4510-bf8a-18897c26df3a.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
We can select the front or back template

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193147110-3f533df7-f997-498e-8652-4cdadb641924.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
and even see the styling section here:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193147146-85f9a64c-31eb-4777-aa57-51f63e672b4c.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">

If you are having issues viewing the font correctly, you can open up the styling -> and change this line of text: "font-family: LG Smart UI Semibold, Verdana, sans-serif;" to a different font family

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193147294-7a5d5ccb-5b75-4266-a128-2aca3b8a4b0f.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">

### Stylistic buttons
You can make other changes to your styles by using the easy interface buttons to the right of the cards area

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193147521-4a77586a-e79c-49c2-afb7-5671bb37a378.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">

### Tags
You can also add tags to help organize your cards in different ways.

### Adding a card. 
When you are finished, just click "Add" to add the card to your deck.

## How to study!
It's really easy to study, you can select a subdeck, or just the main deck if you want to review all the cards without picking a topic.
Just go to the main window with your decks

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193147820-bac29f02-f0c3-4084-b6f8-0cb42189f84a.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
I will minimize the subdecks,

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193147893-d9653165-fea4-45df-bd4e-9c017c98b923.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
Then click the deck name

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193147966-abe38fdc-2f65-43ca-972e-124edf1b7f01.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
Then click study now

You will see the cards go by like so: 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193148067-781c0419-0b07-4deb-a773-0c244099c3db.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">

You can click Again, Hard, Good, Easy depending on how you answered or remembered the answer if you did.
We can see the card we made earlier as well:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193148200-bd33881e-a3ed-4b3c-af09-23f1dfa0170a.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
You can click hints in the bottom left corner to see hints,

and the Category on the right bottom corner is populated by the name of the subdeck (I didn't have to add any tags!)

## Do you want to use Dark Mode?
Did you know Anki has a dark mode feature? 
I'll show you how to set it up!
In the toolbar menu, select Tools->Preferences or (ctrl-p)
You'll see a checkbox next to the words 'Night Mode'

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193148780-fd6a7434-02d6-4b5d-953b-723569fa153a.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
Click it and select close.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106789729/193148832-517013ec-4f07-48f9-818f-b45a7b776dc5.png" alt="Screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
You will see a dialog box that says changes will be made when you restart Anki.

Select okay, and then close Anki and reopen it.
You should see the dark mode working!

## This was a general overview of what you need to know to get started with Anki, for more information about this deck specifically see the readme!
